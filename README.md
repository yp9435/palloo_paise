### *Empowering Rural Women Through Financial Literacy and Technology*  
**Created by Yeshaswi and Gayathri**  

## Inspiration  
In rural India, women often store valuables in the palloo of their sarees, a cultural practice symbolizing trust and security. Yet, only 24% of Indian women are financially literate compared to 35% of men (NCFE, 2017). With over 48% of Indiaâ€™s rural population being female, we saw an opportunity to empower them with financial knowledge and tools. *Palloo Paise* is our attempt to bridge this gap, combining cultural resonance with innovative technology to make financial literacy accessible to every woman.  

## What it does  
*Palloo Paise* is a mobile app designed for rural women to learn, grow, and manage their finances seamlessly. Key features include:  
- **Financial Literacy Lessons**: Beginner-friendly tutorials with read-aloud functionality for differently-abled users.  
- **Government Schemes Awareness**: Highlights financial assistance programs for women with steps to apply, benefits, and links to official sites.  
- **Expense Tracker**: Tracks income and expenses while generating easy-to-read financial reports.  
- **Offline and Multilingual Support**: Provides lessons in multiple languages, accessible even without internet connectivity.  
- **Voice Navigation**: Simplifies app usage for users with limited technical expertise.  

The app is designed with an intuitive UI, using icons to make navigation effortless for elderly and non-tech-savvy individuals.

We built *Palloo Paise* using:  
- **React Native**: For a cross-platform, responsive frontend.  
- **Firebase Authentication and Firestore**: For secure user authentication and data storage.

## What's next for Palloo Paise
